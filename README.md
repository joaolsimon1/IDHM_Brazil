# IDHM_Brazil

This project aims to explore the ggplot2 and rayshader packages with the most recent IDHM data in Brazil, and will reproduced with other indices in the future. The IDHM is an important tool for analyzing socio-economic inequalities among different areas within a country, identifying areas in need of intervention, and tracking progress over time. It ranges from 0 (lowest human development) to 1 (highest human development) and is often used to guide public policies and allocate resources more equitably, aiming to improve the quality of life in communities across the country.
