# IDHM_Brazil

This project aims to explore the [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/reference/plot_gg.html) packages with the [most recent IDHM data in Brazil](http://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/) and can be reproduced with other geospatial data. The IDHM is an important tool for analyzing socio-economic inequalities among different areas within a country, identifying areas in need of intervention, and tracking progress over time. It ranges from 0 (lowest human development) to 1 (highest human development) and is often used to guide public policies and allocate resources more equitably, aiming to improve the quality of life in communities across the country.
